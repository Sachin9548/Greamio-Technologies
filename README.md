📋 Detailed Task Breakdown – CloudBlitz
Enquiry Management System
🎯 Project Goal
Build a Fullstack Enquiry Management System with React + Vite (Frontend) and Node.js +
Express + MongoDB (Backend).
⚡ Important Instruction:

AI tools should be the primary approach for scaolding, refactoring, documentation, and
testing.
Manual coding should only be done to refine or optimize AI-generated output.
The developer should proactively explore and apply the maximum possible AI assistance
throughout the project lifecycle.

⚡ Reminder for Developer:
This project is AI-first. We are not just looking for a coder, but for someone who can:
Use AI development tools expertly.
Save time by generating, refactoring, and documenting code with AI.
Treat AI as a collaborator in development, not just a helper.
